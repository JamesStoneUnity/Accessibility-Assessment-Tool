# Accessibility-Assessment-Tool

This simple tools adds a new window into Unity that allows you to self assess how accessible your game is, based on the guidelines from http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/ - Made during Unity Hackweek 2019.

Just for clarity too, this is not an official Unity plugin, its not supported by anyone other than me, nor do I take any credit for the awesome website that this data came from, I just made a tool as a personal project for Hackweek :)

In order to use this tool, simply import the folder into your project at /Assets/Plugins/

From here you will get a new menu called Accessibility, simply create the new data from the menu (if not already present) and then open the window to start tracking.

** DISCLAIMER **
This project was coded by me during hackweek. The code isnt pretty, its functional, so if you have any issues or find any problems, just let me know and I will fix them. The idea was to get it done within the time limit, so if I have some time later I will tidy it up / refactor it.
